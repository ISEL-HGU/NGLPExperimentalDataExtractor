     * Processing consists of potentially calling <code>closure</code> passing it the current
     * file (which may be a normal file or subdirectory) and then if a subdirectory was encountered,
     * recursively processing the subdirectory. Whether the closure is called is determined by whether
     * the file was a normal file or subdirectory and the value of fileType.
