     * TODO In order to distinguish GenericsType with same name(See GROOVY-8409), we should add a property to keep the declaring class.
     *
     * fixing GROOVY-8409 steps:
     * 1) change the signature of constructor GenericsTypeName to `GenericsTypeName(String name, ClassNode declaringClass)`
     * 2) try to fix all compilation errors(if `GenericsType` has declaringClass property, the step would be a bit easy to fix...)
     * 3) run all tests to see whether the change breaks anything
     * 4) if all tests pass, congratulations! but if some tests are broken, try to debug and find why...
     *
     * We should find a way to set declaring class for `GenericsType` first, it can be completed at the resolving phase.
