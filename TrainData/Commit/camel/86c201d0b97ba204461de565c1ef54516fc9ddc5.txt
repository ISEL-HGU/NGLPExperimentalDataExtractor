         * This should only be used if you have a way to map requests together
         * with replies such as if there is correlation ids in both the request
         * and reply messages. This can be used if you want to multiplex
         * concurrent messages on the same channel (aka connection) in netty.
         * When doing this you must have a way to correlate the request and
         * reply messages so you can store the right reply on the inflight Camel
         * Exchange before its continued routed.
