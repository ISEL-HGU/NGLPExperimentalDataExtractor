         * Whether producer pool is enabled or not. Important: If you turn this
         * off then a single shared connection is used for the producer, also if
         * you are doing request/reply. That means there is a potential issue
         * with interleaved responses if replies comes back out-of-order.
         * Therefore you need to have a correlation id in both the request and
         * reply messages so you can properly correlate the replies to the Camel
         * callback that is responsible for continue processing the message in
         * Camel. To do this you need to implement
         * {@link NettyCamelStateCorrelationManager} as correlation manager and
         * configure it via the <tt>correlationManager</tt> option.
