     * The cache warmup process also depends on there being one poll that fetches nothing - this indicates that the
     * stream has been consumed up to the current point. If the poll duration is excessively long for the rate at
     * which messages are sent on the topic, there exists a possibility that the cache cannot be warmed up and will
     * operate in an inconsistent state relative to its peers until it catches up.
