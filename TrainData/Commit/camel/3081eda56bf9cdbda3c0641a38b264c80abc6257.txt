 * Base implementation of {@link Statistic}
 * <p/>
 * The following modes is available:
 * <ul>
 * <li>VALUE - A statistic with this update mode is a simple value that is a straight forward
 * representation of the updated value.</li>
 * <li>DELTA - A statistic with this update mode is a value that represents the delta
 * between the last two recorded values (or the initial value if two updates have
 * not been recorded). This value can be negative if the delta goes up or down.</li>
 * <li>COUNTER - A statistic with this update mode interprets updates as increments (positive values)
 * or decrements (negative values) to the current value.</li>
 * <li>MAXIMUM - A statistic with this update mode is a value that represents the maximum value
 * amongst the update values applied to this statistic.</li>
 * <li>MINIMUM - A statistic with this update mode is a value that represents the minimum value
 * amongst the update values applied to this statistic.</li>
 * <ul>
