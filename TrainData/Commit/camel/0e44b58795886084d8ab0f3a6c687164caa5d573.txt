     * If enabled and an Exchange failed processing on the consumer side and if the caused Exception 
     * was send back serialized in the response as a application/x-java-serialized-object content type. 
     * On the producer side the exception will be deserialized and thrown as is instead of the HttpOperationFailedException. The caused exception is required to be serialized. 
     * This is by default turned off. If you enable this 
     * then be aware that Java will deserialize the incoming data from the request to Java and that can be a potential security risk.
