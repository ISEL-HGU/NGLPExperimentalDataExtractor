         * This option allows producers and consumers (in client mode) to reuse
         * the same Netty {@link Channel} for the lifecycle of processing the
         * {@link Exchange} . This is useful if you need to call a server
         * multiple times in a Camel route and want to use the same network
         * connection. When using this the channel is not returned to the
         * connection pool until the {@link Exchange} is done; or disconnected
         * if the disconnect option is set to true.
