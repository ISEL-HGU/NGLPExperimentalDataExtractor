 * The file store has a maximum capacity of 32mb by default (you can turn this off and have unlimited size).
 * If the file store grows bigger than the maximum capacity, then the {@link #getDropOldestFileStore()} (is default 1000)
 * number of entries from the file store is dropped to reduce the file store and make room for newer entries.
                // check if we hit maximum capacity (if enabled) and report a warning about this
                if (maxFileStoreSize > 0 && fileStore.length() > maxFileStoreSize) {
     * You can set the value to 0 or negative to turn this off, and have unlimited file store size.
