     * returned set has multiple elements. In this situation there can be
     * thread-safety issues if you process the NODESET concurrently such as from
     * a Camel Splitter EIP in parallel processing mode. This option prevents
     * concurrency issues by doing defensive copies of the nodes. It is
     * recommended to turn this option on if you are using camel-saxon or Saxon
     * in your application. Saxon has thread-safety issues which can be
     * prevented by turning this option on.
