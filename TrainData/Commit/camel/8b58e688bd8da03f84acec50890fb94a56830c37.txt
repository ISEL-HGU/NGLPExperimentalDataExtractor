     * Number of messages aggregated before the aggregation is complete. This option can be set as either
     * a fixed value or using an Expression which allows you to evaluate a size dynamically - will use Integer as result.
     * If both are set Camel will fallback to use the fixed value if the Expression result was null or 0.
     * @param completionSize  the completion size, must be a positive number

     * A repeating period in millis by which the aggregator will complete all current aggregated exchanges.
     * Camel has a background task which is triggered every period. You cannot use this option together
     * with completionTimeout, only one of them can be used.
     * @param completionInterval  the interval in millis, must be a positive value
     * Time in millis that an aggregated exchange should be inactive before its complete (timeout).
