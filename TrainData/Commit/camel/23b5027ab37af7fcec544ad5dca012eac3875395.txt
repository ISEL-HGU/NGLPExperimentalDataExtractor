import java.util.EventObject;

 * The {@link ExchangeSentEvent} is an event which is emitted <b>after</b> the sending is done.
 * <p/>
 * These two events (sending and sent) come in pair, and therefore you need to make sure to return
 * <tt>true</tt> for both events in the {@link org.apache.camel.spi.EventNotifier#isEnabled(EventObject)}
 * method to receive events for either of them.
