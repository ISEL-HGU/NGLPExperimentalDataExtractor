 * The callback is invoked during the routes startup procedure when starting {@link CamelContext}.
 * <p/>
 * <b>Important:</b> You cannot use this listener to add and start new routes to the {@link CamelContext} as this is not
 * supported by design, as this listener plays a role during starting up routes. Instead you can use an {@link org.apache.camel.spi.EventNotifier}
 * and listen on the {@link org.apache.camel.management.event.CamelContextStartedEvent} event and then add and start new routes from there.
