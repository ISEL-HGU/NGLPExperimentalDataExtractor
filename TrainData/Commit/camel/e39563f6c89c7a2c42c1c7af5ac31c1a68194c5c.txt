     * Will use the original input {@link org.apache.camel.Message} when an {@link org.apache.camel.Exchange}
     * is moved to the dead letter queue.
     * <b>Notice:</b> this only applies when all redeliveries attempt have failed and the {@link org.apache.camel.Exchange}
     * is doomed for failure.
     * Instead of using the current inprogress {@link org.apache.camel.Exchange} IN message we use the original
     * IN message instead. This allows you to store the original input in the dead letter queue instead of the inprogress
     * snapshot of the IN message.
     * store in the dead letter queue it might be easier to manually re submit the {@link org.apache.camel.Exchange}
     * again as the IN message is the same as when Camel received it.
     * So you should be able to send the {@link org.apache.camel.Exchange} to the same input.
