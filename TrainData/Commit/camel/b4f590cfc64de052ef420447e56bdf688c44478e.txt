         * LinkedIn access token to avoid username and password login procedure.
         * LinkedIn responds to login forms by using a CAPTCHA. This makes it
         * impossible for a standalone, headless process to log in to LinkedIn
         * by specifying a username and password. To work around this, obtain a
         * LinkedIn access token and provide the token as the setting of the
         * accessToken parameter. Obtaining a LinkedIn access token is a
         * multi-step procedure. You must configure your LinkedIn application,
         * obtain a LinkedIn authorization code, and exchange that code for the
         * LinkedIn access token. For details, see:
         * https://developer.linkedin.com/docs/oauth2 The default behavior is
         * that the access token expires after 60 days. To change this, specify
         * a value for the expiryTime paramter. If the access token expires, the
         * LinkedIn component tries to log in to LinkedIn by providing a
         * username and password, which results in a CAPTCHA so the login fails.
         * The LinkedIn component cannot refresh the access token. You must
         * manually obtain a new access token each time an access token expires.
         * When you update the access token you must restart the application so
         * that it uses the new token.
