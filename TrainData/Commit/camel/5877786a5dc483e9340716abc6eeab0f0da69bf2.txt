 * <b>Important:</b> Implementations of this should use <tt>String</tt> as the generic type as that is
 * what is required by Camel to allow using the idempotent repository with the Idempotent Consumer EIP
 * and also as file consumer read-lock. It was a mistake to make {@link IdempotentRepository} parameterized,
 * as it should have been a pre-configured to use a <tt>String</tt> type.
