    //   where unit of work is doing a bit more work than the transactional aspect that ties
    //   to its name. Maybe this implementation should be named ExchangeContext and we can
    //   introduce a simpler UnitOfWork concept. This would also allow us to refactor the
    //   SubUnitOfWork into a general parent/child unit of work concept. However this
    //   requires API changes and thus is best kept for Camel 3.0
