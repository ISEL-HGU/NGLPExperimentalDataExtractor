     * Returns an arbitrary REST resource representing this UserContext. The
     * REST resource returned must be properly annotated with JSR-311
     * annotations, and may serve as the root resource for any number of
     * subresources. The returned resource is ultimately exposed at
     * ".../api/session/ext/IDENTIFIER/", where IDENTIFIER is the identifier of
     * the AuthenticationProvider associated with this UserContext.
     * REST resources returned by this function will only be reachable by
     * authenticated users with valid authentication tokens. REST resources
     * which should be accessible by all users regardless of whether they have
     * authenticated should instead be returned from
     * AuthenticationProvider.getResource().
