 * Capabilities which may not be present in all versions of the Guacamole
 * protocol.
     * The protocol does not require handshake instructions to be sent in a
     * specific order, nor that all handshake instructions be sent. Arbitrary
     * handshake order was introduced in
     * {@link GuacamoleProtocolVersion#VERSION_1_1_0}.
     * Negotiation of Guacamole protocol version between client and server
     * during the protocol handshake. The ability to negotiate protocol
     * versions was introduced in
     * {@link GuacamoleProtocolVersion#VERSION_1_1_0}.
     * Support for the "timezone" handshake instruction. The "timezone"
     * instruction allows the client to request that the server forward their
     * local timezone for use within the remote desktop session. Support for
     * forwarding the client timezone was introduced in
     * {@link GuacamoleProtocolVersion#VERSION_1_1_0}.
