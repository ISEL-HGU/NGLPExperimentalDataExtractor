     * supported, it will simply be dropped. Any attributes not within the given
     * map will be left untouched. Attributes which are not declared within
     * getUserAttributes() of the associated UserContext MUST NOT be submitted,
     * but other extensions may manipulate the declared attributes through
     * decorate() and redecorate().
     * 
     * Implementations may optionally allow storage of unsupported attributes.
     * Extensions which rely on other extensions to store their attribute
     * values should verify that such storage is supported by first testing
     * that the attribute value is retrievable via getAttributes() after being
     * set.
