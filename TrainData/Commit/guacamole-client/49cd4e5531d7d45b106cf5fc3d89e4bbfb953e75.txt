     * function will always be the full configuration to be used to establish
     * the connection, as provided when this SimpleConnection was created or via
     * {@link #setConfiguration(org.apache.guacamole.protocol.GuacamoleConfiguration)}.

     * <p>This implementation will connect using the GuacamoleConfiguration
     * returned by {@link #getFullConfiguration()}, honoring the
     * "guacd-hostname", "guacd-port", and "guacd-ssl" properties set within
     * guacamole.properties. Parameter tokens will be taken into account if
     * the SimpleConnection was explicitly requested to do so when created.
     *
     * <p>Implementations requiring more complex behavior should consider using
     * the {@link AbstractConnection} base class or implementing
     * {@link Connection} directly.
