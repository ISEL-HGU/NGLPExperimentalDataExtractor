        // a timestamped snapshot version of the form x.y.z-<timestamped-part> represents the real
        // x.y.z-SNAPSHOT version
        // this version matcher only comes into picture if we have been asked to deal with a
        // timestamped snapshot. In other words, if the asked version isn't a timestamped snapshot,
        // then we don't accept it
     * Parses the passed {@code revision} and returns a {@link MavenSnapshotRevision}, representing
     * that {@code revision}, if it is either a regular snapshot (for example: 1.0.2-SNAPSHOT) or a
     * timestamped snapshot (for example: 1.0.2-20100925.223013-19).
     * @return MavenSnapshotRevision
        return timestampedSnaphost ? new MavenSnapshotRevision(true, revision, snapshotPatternMatcher.group(1))
                : new MavenSnapshotRevision(false, revision, revision.substring(0, revision.indexOf(SNAPSHOT_SUFFIX)));
     * Represents a Maven 2 snapshot version, which is either a regular snapshot
     * (for example: 1.0.2-SNAPSHOT) or a timestamped snapshot (for example:
     * 1.0.2-20100925.223013-19)
         * Returns true if this {@link MavenSnapshotRevision} represents a timestamped snapshot
         * version. Else returns false.
         * @return boolean
         * Returns the "base" revision that this {@link MavenSnapshotRevision} represents. For
         * example, for the regular snapshot revision {@link 1.2.3-SNAPSHOT}, the base revision
         * is {@code 1.2.3}. Similarly for timestamped snapshot version
         * @return String
         * Returns the complete/whole revision this {@link MavenSnapshotRevision} represents. For
         * example, if this {@link MavenSnapshotRevision} represents a regular snapshot
         * {@code 1.3.4-SNAPSHOT} revision then this method returns {@code 1.3.4-SNAPSHOT}.
         * Similarly, if this {@link MavenSnapshotRevision} represents a timestamped snapshot
         * {@code 1.0.2-20100925.223013-19} revision, then this method returns
         * @return String
