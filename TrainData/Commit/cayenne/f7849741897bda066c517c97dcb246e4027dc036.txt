 * Object representing Cayenne stack. Serves as an entry point to Cayenne for user applications and a factory of ObjectContexts.
 * Implementation is a thin wrapper of the dependency injection container.
 * <p>The "Server" prefix in the name is in contrast to ROP "client" (that is started via ClientRuntime). So
 * ServerRuntime is the default Cayenne stack that you should be using in all apps with the exception of client-side ROP.</p>
