     * @param metaData The annotation-instance which was found or the inherited instance.
     *                 Since it's possible to override annotation-attributes alongside the inheritance-path,
     *                 it can be a merged representation.
     *                 To get rid of meta-data which is only inherited,
     *                 it's required to check the presence of the physical annotation e.g. via
     *                 ViewConfigNode#getSource#isAnnotationPresent
     *                 and return a synthetic literal-instance (as a marker/placeholder),
     *                 because 'null' isn't supported as return-value.
     * @param viewConfigNode Instance which represents the current node
     * @return The annotation-instance which should be used for the final meta-data
     */
