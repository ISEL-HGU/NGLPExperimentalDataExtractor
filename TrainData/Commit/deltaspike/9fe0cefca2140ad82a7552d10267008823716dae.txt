/**
 * This interface provides high-level controls for the scheduler.
 *
 * It allows to control the scheduler as a whole ({@link #isSchedulerEnabled()}()) and on a per-job basis
 * ({@link #shouldJobBeStarted(Class)}.
 *
 * The interface is meant to be implemented by injectable beans. The default implementation (DefaultSchedulerControl in
 * deltaspike-scheduler-impl) always returns {@code true} on both functions. It can be replaced by providing a bean,
 * which @{@link javax.enterprise.inject.Specializes} it, or by any other CID mechanism.
